## Issues with `tsc`

`tsc`, the native [TypeScript CLI](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html), pretty much offers everything that we need to compile and bundle our TypeScript libraries. We opted for [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) due to `tsc` lacks of support for CSS imports, a requirement for enabling Chromatic's [TurboSnap](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/turbosnap) feature.

Given that either TurboSnap requirements or `tsc` CSS imports support change, we will reevaluate this decision.
