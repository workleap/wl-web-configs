# Browserslist

## Supported browsers

You can find an exhaustive list of the browser versions included with this shared configuration on [https://browsersl.ist](https://browsersl.ist/#q=%3E+0.2%25%2C+last+2+versions%2C+Firefox+ESR%2C+not+dead). 

Alternatively, to list the browser versions supported by a specific configuration file, you can open a terminal at the root of any project including a `.browserslistrc` file and execute the following command:

```bash
npx browserslist
```
