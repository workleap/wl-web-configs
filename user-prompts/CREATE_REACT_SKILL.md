I want to create a new React skill in `./agent-skills/workleap-react-best-practices`.

There is no existing skill that fully matches our needs at Workleap, so we will create a custom one focused on Single Page Applications built with React.

Please use the locally installed `skill-creator` tool to generate this new skill.

The content should be strongly inspired by Vercel’s React Best Practices skill:
[https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/react-best-practices](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/react-best-practices)

However, exclude all rules from the following categories:

* Server-Side Performance
* Client-Side Data Fetching

Also exclude any rules related to:

* Vercel
* Next.js
* SWC
* SSR
* Server-side rendering
* Any server-side specific concepts

You may spawn up to two subagents to assist, review, and validate the output before finalizing the skill.
